## Structure

- I don't hate the idea of quoting former Sandberg students!



## building servers, squatting (online)

- domain squatting
- piggybacking
- **feminist server summit, maintenance care**
- what is the difference between a server and a boat?
- **what would a nomadic server be? and why would this be a good thing?**
- websites and opening times: why don't we turn our servers off at night?
  - redirect them to one central page that logs different opening hours for different services?
- why should people use my shitty tool/server/whatever?
  - **DIY Perks lol**

- wind powered, autonomous server/powered with a fan
- **mesh networks**
- software is never finished, you always need to maintain it
  - like a boat, like a squat, like life
- What could a wifi dish do on a boat?



## cyber prepping

- IPFS
- collapse OS: an operating system that can run on almost anything when society collapses
- Scuttlebutt
- Cyberdecks



## Squatting (offline)

- amsterdam, city of squats



## Online Communities

- Metverse etc
  - the trust people with their 3d interfaces
  - **where are they hosted?**
- how to writing, how are tech tutorials written (with amy's class)

  - anja case stories
  - **stackoverflow: asking how to do a thing, getting told you shouldn't do it!**



## What is autonomy?

- the guy building a toaster from scratch
- D I Why?

  - why do people want to get off grid?
- autonomy vs interdependence. Hermitism vs. community.
- your computer doesn't belong to you



## Nobody likes big tech

- **tech is a race to the brain stem!**

- big tech is exploitative, and that is not an accident, that is by design
  - pursuasive technology lab, youtube algorithms, pull to refresh, like button etc

- we are also talking about government/military technology here
- You can't reinstall Adobe before CS5, they disactivated the servers for activation
  - [even if you bought the phsyical CDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEP_7_gx6M8)



## counter culture and computers

- counter culture and computers have the same history
- why did so many communes fail?
- **steve jobs was once homeless (thinking about priviledge)**
- richard stalman can afford to be super extreme in terms of privacy, but can i/you/we? he is in a position to do this!
  - also all the silicon valley millionaires that don't let their children use tech
  - who can just miss work for two weeks?
  - the ultimate dropout is ted kaczynski
    - Welcome to my Ted-Kaczynski-Talk
  - anprim, reject modernity embrace tradition
- **anarchist yacht club**
  - there are multiple kinds of boats. there is the big yacht, or the refurbished, squatted, **communal** boat. 
  - What does that do with the ocean metaphor?
- **pirate radios**
  - talking about ocean as a free space etc. it's not only bad.



## Back to the land/sea/whatever

- **VPNs are scams for privacy (internet historian could be a funny reference here)**

  - somewhere in my notes

  - the desire for privacy, but also being totally misinformed

- **I say there is a digital back to the land movement, but where is that true??**

  - everybody hates facebook/instagram
  - fake news, vaccinations
  - vpns!
  - *see cyber prepping*



## natural tech metaphors

- **where does the ocean metaphor come from?**
  - in which ways does it actually fail in which ways does it hold up, can it be useful? or is it only occluding?
    - *see pirate radios*
  - can it be in the essay?
- water and electricity don't mix
  - **boating is not exactly a working class hobby**
- back to the land movement!
  - what does that mean digitally, what is 'the land'? it's not the cloud for sure!
  - it's also certainly not the ocean...
  - **If the internet used to be an ocean that can be surfed etc, what is it now?**
  - **the story of the woman who invented the term surfing the web is very interesting**
- the network is eternal and so is the ocean
- the term cloud literally meant the "unknown" part of a network diagram, the internet.
- **cybernetics comes from captain! sovereignty over spaces.**
- inter"net", fishnet
- I just want to say blog, blogbook, vlog etc again. vlogbook. I wonder if anyone on youtube has mader that joke.
- I liek this idea of [the waste](https://howlscastle.fandom.com/wiki/The_Waste), the land outside that you cannot enter.
  - The evil internet of sorts, and your little digital platform, or boat, or moving castle, or luxury van, or spaceship is the thing that alloows you to survive in this otherwise hostile environment
  - from trust. might be a good followup to the cloud story?
