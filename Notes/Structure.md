# Structure

1. **Cloud Gazing**
   1. The cloud is elusive, it feels like you have no control
   2. The term cloud veils what it actually describes
   3. When we want to escape it, where do we go?
2. **Surfing the Web**
   1. In the 90s, we surfed the web, it was fun and exciting
   2. But nobody *surfs* that anymore
   3. The idea of the open and free internet, like an ocean, still lingers
3. **Back to the Sea**
   1. Some people have taken this idea of the free ocean literally
   2. But turns out the ocean is not as free as people think
4. **Unordered List of Reasons to Refuse the Cloud**
   1. there are a lot of problems with *the cloud*, let's just agree on this
5. **Back to the Land**
   1. And of course the internet is not free either
   2. It's made from cables, mirrors the inequalities of real life
   3. And it's not a separate space anymoreâ€”it's augmented on our life
   4. If we want to go "back to the land", we need to think about infrastructure
6. **Hotel Mokum**
   1. We squatted a building, did a lot of cool shit
   2. We were exhausted, neglecting our lives
   3. But we had built a support network for ourselves
7. **Architectures of (De-)Appropriation**
   1. Quick history of squatting in NL
   2. Squatting is open source
   3. Squatting is all about embedding yourself in a network
   4. but this network is according to different values: solidarity
8. **Who Would Win?**
   1. squatting and self hosting are more similar than you think

  - women of surinam movie?
  - **we have apartments, why didwe need hotel mokum?**
- do i need to clarify that there are different kinds of "autonomy"
  - seasteading vs. pirate radio
  - the slick mesh network tool
  - VPNs, mainstream, commodification, arrested development
  - libertarian leisure culture
- when did the internet become a cloud?
  - the moment it transitioned from arpanet, internet archive guy's text
- influence of counter culture on computers and the internet
  - hippies, but also hacker culture!
  - **CCC?**
- Deciding who can be a part
  - open source/door policies
- How is what I am saying different to the discourse of the 80s?
  - How is our squat different?
  - How is our server different?
- Mesh networks
  - could be connected to squats
- Trust article about **the waste**
  - seems like they want to avoid the land, be in their little containers
  - maybe we need to start living in the waste
