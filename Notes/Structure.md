# Structure

0. **Who Would Win?**
   1. squatting and self hosting are more similar than you think

1. **Cloud Gazing**
   1. The cloud is elusive, it feels like you have no control
   2. The term cloud veils what it actually describes
   3. When we want to escape it, where do we go?
2. **Surfing the Web**
   1. In the 90s, we surfed the web, it was fun and exciting
   2. But nobody *surfs* anymore
   3. The idea of the open and free internet, like an ocean, still lingers
3. **Back to the Sea**
   1. There is a libertarian phantasy connected to the ocean
   1. But it turns out, the ocean is not actually that free!
4. **Back to the Land**
   1. And of course the internet is not free either
   2. It's made from cables, mirrors the inequalities of real life
   3. And it's not a separate space anymoreâ€”it's augmented on our life
   4. If we want to go "back to the land", we need to think about infrastructure
   4. Luckily we are already good at negotiating physical space
5. **Occupying the Land**
   1. Quick history of squatting in NL
   2. Squatting is open source
   3. Squatting is all about embedding yourself in a network
   4. but this network is according to different values: solidarity
6. **Hotel Mokum**
   1. We squatted a building, did a lot of cool shit
   2. We were exhausted, neglecting our lives
   3. But we had built a support network for ourselves
7. **Trespassing, an Afterword**
   1. In Amsterdam, the physical and the digital really merge (airbnb)
   2. In this technofeudal nightmare, those who know how to code can survive
   3. but in groups, you can do anything lol (the squatters helped us build toilets)
8. **Appendix: Unordered List of Reasons to Refuse the Cloud**
   1. there are a lot of problems with *the cloud*, let's just agree on this

# Things that need to change

- i don't like the way the thundercloud logo is used atm, it's not an image like the others somehow.
- **tina latest feedback**
  - **prep talk**

- flavia says that i need to rethink the "collapse" sentence
  - *community building*
- footnotes in general
  - maybe sometimes i could use them to explain, rather than just a link
  - refusal list
  - footnotes go after punctuation says tina
- images
  - squatting sign probably
  - how to show a network diagram with cloud?
- **go through every chapter and check how it answers my main questions**
  - **what is autonomoy, what are autonomous spaces, what are interdependent spaces**
  - **what are different ideas of freedom, freedom from what, with who, how?**
- for the last thing, reasons to refuse the cloud
  - how are all these points related to an idea of **augmented** internet?

# Things that are Missing

- where do squatting and tech actually mix
  - where are we using (big) tech to squat?
    - google maps
    - twitter
    - instagram for promotion
    - but also self hosting, wifi dish, encrypted server
    - potentially mesh networks
  - ==airbnb is the mix of tech, or the cloud, and housing==
  - but it goes the other way around, too: tech is penetrating our houses, the two issues are no longer separate
    - smart homes, but also just internet cables, devices
- Smart Cities, like the line
  - could be a cool image
- Why is everything a space?
  - Why is crypto a space?
  - Why are chats chatRooms?
  - Why are discord servers spaces? Because they are behind a paywall? Is a paid new york times article also a space?
- Refusal
  - Jenny Odell, the third space!
  - ==Silvio says becoming a non-user can be more powerful than a hacker==
- Urgency
  - This is really a key point, also architectures of appropriation wise. The aesthetics is defined by urgency
    - when you stop squatting, it stops being so urgent
  - Nomadism
    - Flusser says we are all nomads now, because of the way information penetrates our lives, there is no differenciation between public and private
      - this alone already relates to squatting
    - squatting is always precarious, always ad-hoc, at the same time dependent on location and independent from it. always nomadic
    - every squat ends!
    - everyone is talking about digital nomads, but flusser argues we already are nomads, have always been, and everything is digital
  - clarify: it's not about being separate from the city, necessarily, but being so much at home in it that your house is all over
- Reusing what is there
  - **the server than ada built compared to a linux cyberdeck**
  - **reusing what is there**
  - relating this to architectures of apropriation
  - the computer you buy matters more than what you make on it
- Different ideas of freedom
  - autonomy is not (only) about separating yourself
  - the discussion about who to let in
    - gatekeeping, stackoverflow
    - open source/door policies
    - licensing (varia, check link form mike)
    - principles of squatting applied to tech
    - seasteading is also open source. Flavia: who is going to clean?
  - Libertarian Leisure culture
    - steve jobs homeless
  - seasteading vs. pirate radio
  - the slick mesh network tool
  - cyberdecks
    - cyberprepping
  - VPNs, mainstream, commodification, arrested development (something with privacy i guess? fake block)
  - libertarian leisure culture
- privilege/survival?
  - steve jobs was homeless
  - women of surinam movie?
  - **we have apartments, why didwe need hotel mokum?**
    - ==housing crisis, price increase amsterdam, from 2010 150%==
      - [link](https://www.statista.com/statistics/612227/average-rent-in-four-largest-cities-in-the-netherlands-by-city/)
    - 2010 really is where it all went wrong lol
  - maybe i could include where i wrote this thesis, both on a mac, and in sweden, both in company of my closest childhood friend and with an open source aproach.
    - abstract?
  - **i don't think this needs to be a point but read the essay one time with this in mind. What is the precarity of living in Amsterdam?**
- when did the internet become a cloud?
  - the moment it transitioned from arpanet, internet archive guy's text
  - techno feudalism
  - 2010, year of the squatting ban!
  - a few owning what belongs to the many
- influence of counter culture on computers and the internet
  - hippies, but also hacker culture!
  - **CCC?**
