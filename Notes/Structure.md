# Structure

0. **Who Would Win?**
   1. squatting and self hosting are more similar than you think

1. **Cloud Gazing**
   1. The cloud is elusive, it feels like you have no control
   2. The term cloud veils what it actually describes
   3. When we want to escape it, where do we go?
2. **Surfing the Web**
   1. In the 90s, we surfed the web, it was fun and exciting
   2. But nobody *surfs* anymore
   3. The idea of the open and free internet, like an ocean, still lingers
3. **Back to the Sea**
   1. There is a libertarian phantasy connected to the ocean
   1. But it turns out, the ocean is not actually that free!
4. **Back to the Land**
   1. And of course the internet is not free either
   2. It's made from cables, mirrors the inequalities of real life
   3. And it's not a separate space anymoreâ€”it's augmented on our life
   4. If we want to go "back to the land", we need to think about infrastructure
   4. Luckily we are already good at negotiating physical space
5. **Occupying the Land**
   1. Quick history of squatting in NL
   2. Squatting is open source
   3. Squatting is all about embedding yourself in a network
   4. but this network is according to different values: solidarity
6. **Hotel Mokum**
   1. We squatted a building, did a lot of cool shit
   2. We were exhausted, neglecting our lives
   3. But we had built a support network for ourselves
7. **Trespassing, an Afterword**
   1. In Amsterdam, the physical and the digital really merge (airbnb)
   2. In this technofeudal nightmare, those who know how to code can survive
   3. but in groups, you can do anything lol (the squatters helped us build toilets)
8. **Appendix: Unordered List of Reasons to Refuse the Cloud**
   1. there are a lot of problems with *the cloud*, let's just agree on this

# Things that need to change

- images
  - squatting sign probably
  - how to show a network diagram with cloud?
  - i don't like the way the thundercloud logo is used atm, it's not an image like the others somehow
    - maybe squat adobe cloud?

# Things that are Missing

- where do squatting and tech actually mix
  - but it goes the other way around, too: tech is penetrating our houses, the two issues are no longer separate
    - smart homes, but also just internet cables, devices
  - Smart Cities, like the line
    - could be a cool image
  - smart homes, smart cities
- Why is everything a space?
  - Why is crypto a space?
  - Why are chats chatRooms?
  - Why are discord servers spaces? Because they are behind a paywall? Is a paid new york times article also a space?
- Refusal
  - Jenny Odell, the third space!
