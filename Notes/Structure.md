# Structure

1. **Who Would Win?**
   1. squatting and self hosting are more similar than you think
2. **Cloud Gazing**
   1. The cloud is elusive, it feels like you have no control
   2. The term cloud veils what it actually describes
   3. When we want to escape it, where do we go?
3. **Surfing the Web**
   1. In the 90s, we surfed the web, it was fun and exciting
   2. But nobody *surfs* anymore
   3. The idea of the open and free internet, like an ocean, still lingers
4. **Back to the Sea**
   1. Some people have taken this idea of the free ocean literally
   2. But turns out the ocean is not as free as people think
5. **Back to the Land**
   1. And of course the internet is not free either
   2. It's made from cables, mirrors the inequalities of real life
   3. And it's not a separate space anymoreâ€”it's augmented on our life
   4. If we want to go "back to the land", we need to think about infrastructure
6. **Hotel Mokum**
   1. We squatted a building, did a lot of cool shit
   2. We were exhausted, neglecting our lives
   3. But we had built a support network for ourselves
7. **Architectures of (De-)Appropriation**
   1. Quick history of squatting in NL
   2. Squatting is open source
   3. Squatting is all about embedding yourself in a network
   4. but this network is according to different values: solidarity
8. **Appendix: Unordered List of Reasons to Refuse the Cloud**
   1. there are a lot of problems with *the cloud*, let's just agree on this

# Things that need to change

- new abstract
  - from abstract to material (literally since this is the abstract)
  - nomadism, traveling the chapters

- The Pirate meme!
  - also flavia says that i need to rethink the "collapse" sentence
  - *community building*
- diagrams
- The ending is too short
  - where does private property intersect with the cloud?
  - is the network still a network?
  - daniel loick, the private property guy!
- part 2 and 3 are too long
  - footnotes!
- need to work over the reasons to refuse list.
  - does everything fit there?
  - for example the suicide part. I think it makes sense because it happened in the transition from network to cloud, but then this has to be more explicit
  - footnotes!
- footnotes in general
  - maybe sometimes i could use them to explain, rather than just a link
- want to try who would win as a kind of index
  - cross references!

# Things that are Missing

- where do squatting and tech actually mix
  - where are we using (big) tech to squat?
    - google maps
    - twitter
    - instagram for promotion
    - but also self hosting, wifi dish, encrypted server
    - potentially mesh networks
- Refusal
  - Jenny Odell, the third space!
  - Silvio says becoming a non-user can be more powerful than a hacker

- security: barrication/encryption
- Urgency
  - James Bridle makes the point that you **shouldn't** need to understand tech to use it
    - like you can shit without knowing plumbing or being scared your toilet will kill you
    - in opposition to alexander galloway
    - **i'm not so sure about this, also why shouldn't we know about plumbing?**
      - Silvio actually also write about this question
    - When you squat, you will learn about plumbing
  - This is really a key point, also architectures of appropriation wise. The aesthetics is defined by urgency
    - when you stop squatting, it stops being so urgent
  - Nomadism
    - Flusser says we are all nomads now, because of the way information penetrates our lives, there is no differenciation between public and private
      - this alone already relates to squatting
    - squatting is always precarious, always ad-hoc, at the same time dependent on location and independent from it. always nomadic
    - every squat ends!
  - clarify: it's not about being separate from the city, necessarily, but being so much at home in it that your house is all over
- Reusing what is there
  - **the server than ada built compared to a linux cyberdeck**
  - **reusing what is there**
  - relating this to architectures of apropriation
  - the computer you buy matters more than what you make on it
- Different ideas of freedom
  - autonomy is not (only) about separating yourself
  - the discussion about who to let in
    - gatekeeping, stackoverflow
    - open source/door policies
    - licensing (varia, check link form mike)
    - principles of squatting applied to tech
    - seasteading is also open source. Flavia: who is going to clean?
  - Libertarian Leisure culture
    - steve jobs homeless
  - seasteading vs. pirate radio
  - the slick mesh network tool
  - cyberdecks
    - cyberprepping
  - VPNs, mainstream, commodification, arrested development (something with privacy i guess? fake block)
  - libertarian leisure culture
- what is the meaning of antikraak?

- Text Silvio
  - he also makes the point that spatial metaphors disappear after mobile phones came along
- dependencies can be addictions.
  - tech and drugs are the only industries that call their customers *user*
  - **new** dependencies are not addictions
- privilege/survival?
  - steve jobs was homeless
  - women of surinam movie?
  - **we have apartments, why didwe need hotel mokum?**
  - maybe i could include where i wrote this thesis, both on a mac, and in sweden, both in company of my closest childhood friend and with an open source aproach.
    - abstract?
  - **i don't think this needs to be a point but read the essay one time with this in mind. What is the precarity of living in Amsterdam?**
- when did the internet become a cloud?
  - the moment it transitioned from arpanet, internet archive guy's text
  - techno feudalism
  - 2010, year of the squatting ban!
  - a few owning what belongs to the many
- How does the cloud connect to the Netherlands specifically? Data centers etc?
- influence of counter culture on computers and the internet
  - hippies, but also hacker culture!
  - **CCC?**
