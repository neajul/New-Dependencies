**Missing dependencies—an essay without answers**

How can we create meaningful change in the virtual sandboxes and their inherent inequalities, that we inhabit as online, and from where can we do this?



- We cannot change the cloud
  - the internet was always a cloud, the space behind the blinking lights we don't know about
  - and the cloud is not really a cloud anyway
  - it's also not everywhere
- squatting and counter culture 60s—90s
  - political action but also tactic to survive
  - influence of counter culture on the digital
- Before the cloud was a cloud it was an ocean
  - history of geographical terminology to describe the virtual
  - libertarian leisure culture, tax evasion and self sufficiency
  - who gets to go to the beach, who has boats?
- Digital and Physical are not seperate: real spaces, servers, cables, routers, rooms, real inequalities
  - and they inform each other anyway, we understand space through the digital
  - don't need to treat them separately
  - virtual: simulated on top of existing infrastructure
  - sandbox: only within the rules of the interface
- dependencies in this case becomes addiction
  - by design (persuasive technology lab, military tech)
  - your computer doesn't belong to you
  - t h e   s t a c k   goes deep (guy building his toaster)
  - most servers run on green energy, but hardware is an equally big problem (lithium)
  - need to have a part about what i mean with real inequalities
  - and that this is not just about a bunch of people that get depressed from instagram
  - if you're not a user you're a loser
    - it's growing, but there is also a counter movement growing
    - i'm sure i can find more examples
    - example: gotenna
    - example: VPNs are mainstream now (Nord VPN for example)
      - only problem: then the VPN has your data
- To change the virtual we need to act from outside the virtual
  - spatial logic: same as housing crisis, we have a space problem
    - and the spaces are real rooms and boxes and cables
  - refusal, don't play by the rules, i'd rather not
    - new dependencies, communal efforts
  - spaces outside of it, thinking about infrastructure, create a different virtual
    - servers, infrastrctures
    - **making things available**
      - also think about to who
      - steve jobs was once homeless
      - who are the ones that get to drop out?
    - so many tools already exist, and we can build more
  - maintenance/care
    - something about boats?
  - constant negotiation
  - data loss and eviction always imminent
  - maybe not always available (power consumption), potentially running on old hardware since that's the only ethical hardware that exists
- Somehow all of this is old news
  - many people are advocating for this already
  - these movements exist since the 1980s
  - linux, richard stalman etc
  - so maybe the question is more: how to make them more inclusive?





it's not just larping

also: tech companies don't comply to government standards and that's a pretty low bar
