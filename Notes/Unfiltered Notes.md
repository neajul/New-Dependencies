# Structure

* I don't hate the idea of quoting former Sandberg students
* Why are so many of my things from 2008?
  * **using references from the wayback machine, what does that mean?**
  * and what is going on today? it's not 2008 anymore
* How much personal stories do I want to include?
* logbook character is also in the dates that I mention.
  * Sort chronological lol

## building servers, squatting (online)

* **Hot take: it's not possible to work against the platform from within the platform.**

* It's not just about alternatives, but also about understanding

* **For some people, these things are about survival!**
  * *Same as offline squatting*
  
* A level of complexity that makes individual action seem futile

* domain squatting
  * A domain is like an address (human legible), an IP is like coordinates (machine legible)
  * and actually urls used to be address bars, that is an intentional analogy
  
* **piggybacking**

* Sharing accounts?

  * making available, depropriating (incellectuals? activism?)
  * **might be fun to ask joeri**

* SEO gaming
  * rick santorum: parody website that alsways ranked higher than actual guy (Jan)
  
* **feminist server summit, maintenance care**

* what is the difference between a server and a boat?

* **what would a nomadic server be? and why would this be a good thing?**

  > As such, tools are the result of thinking form, function, time, and outcome together. When labour becomes nomadic, tools adapt. When nomadic tools develop, labour follows. Tools follow function.

  — Fanfare Inc (Miquel's thesis)
  
* websites and opening times: why don't we turn our servers off at night?
  * redirect them to one central page that logs different opening hours for different services?
  
* why should people use my shitty tool/server/whatever?
  * **DIY Perks lol**
  * buggy. dataloss is always imminent.
  * *see squats*
  
* wind powered, autonomous server/powered with a fan

* **mesh networks**

* software is never finished, you always need to maintain it
  * like a boat, like a squat, like life
  
* **What are dependencies?**
  * dependencies and addictions.
  * Only tech and drug users quote!

## cyber prepping

* IPFS
* collapse OS: an operating system that can run on almost anything when society collapses
* Scuttlebutt
* Cyberdecks

## Squatting (offline)

* amsterdam, city of squats
* evicition is always imminent
  * *see building servers*
* Deporpriating instead of apropriating, **making available**
  * **available to who?**
  * In a way things that are being discussed in open source community are super obvious in squatting community, no you can NOT come in
  * *See Online communities*
* **Squatting is just a tactic,** nazis can squat as well!
  * *see: domain squatting*
* **And: for some it's survival, not political action**
  * *same with digital squatting*
* squatting around the world
  * squatted cities in china

## Online Communities

* Metaverse etc
  * the trust people with their 3d interfaces
  * **where are they hosted?**
* how to writing, how are tech tutorials written (with amy's class)
  * anja case stories
  * **stackoverflow: asking how to do a thing, getting told you shouldn't do it!**
* open source has pitfalls as well (Tal)
  * **Licensing: who gets to use my code?**
  * Varia, what licenses are there?
  * *See squatting*
* Alternatives exist:
  * mastodon, nextcloud etc. But of course not for everyone, and not for everything. **They are exclusive, too.**

## What is autonomy?

* **Literally: What does autonomy mean, where does the word come from, how is it used etc???**
  * what is an autonomous practice?
  * what are autonmous spaces: what is space, who defines it, what are the paradigms, how is it structured/organised?
* the guy building a toaster from scratch
* D I Why?
  * why do people want to get off grid?
* autonomy vs interdependence. Hermitism vs. community.
* your computer doesn't belong to you
* How deep does the stack go?
* Libertarian Leisure Culture

## Nobody likes big tech

* **tech is a race to the brain stem!**
* big tech is exploitative, and that is not an accident, that is by design
  * pursuasive technology lab, youtube algorithms, pull to refresh, like button etc
* we are also talking about government/military technology here
  * but only american military
* You can't reinstall Adobe before CS5, they disactivated the servers for activation
  * [even if you bought the phsyical CDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEP_7_gx6M8)

## counter culture and computers

* counter culture and computers have the same history
* why did so many communes fail?
* **steve jobs was once homeless (thinking about priviledge)**
* richard stalman can afford to be super extreme in terms of privacy, but can i/you/we? he is in a position to do this!
  * also all the silicon valley millionaires that don't let their children use tech
  * who can just miss work for two weeks?
* the ultimate dropout is ted kaczynski
  * Welcome to my Ted-Kaczynski-Talk
  * anprim, reject modernity embrace tradition
* **anarchist yacht club**
  * there are multiple kinds of boats. there is the big yacht, or the refurbished, squatted, **communal** boat.
  * What does that do with the ocean metaphor?
* **pirate radios**
  * talking about ocean as a free space etc. it's not only bad.

## Back to the land/sea/whatever

* **I say there is a digital back to the land movement, but where is that true?**
  * everybody hates facebook/instagram
  * fake news, vaccinations
  * vpns!
  * *see cyber prepping*
* **VPNs are scams for privacy (internet historian could be a funny reference here)**
  * somewhere in my notes
  * the desire for privacy, but also being totally misinformed
* Where are the overlaps between online and offline squatting? For example: we use cryptpad, signal, matrix server. We steal the internet of the hotel across the street.
  * How do they inform each other?
  * **What is this amsterdam squat net??**
* User-citizen similarities
* The user—citizen divide
  * what rights do we have where, and how do they inform each other?
  * they are not separate! (tubes, smooth/sad woman)
  * users do not get to vote!
    * of course participation is voluntary, **but is it really?*
      * if you're not a user, you are a loser lol
  * sovereignty: users can only act within the interface, they cannot break out
    * like squatting is a good way to say fuck it, we leave the system
    * what are ways of doing this digitally? replace the tools that oppress you?
  * Funny how it seems like all these issues were solved in the 80s (linux, squatting)
* Tech doesn't conform to the same standards as governments (which is a pretty low bar)
* Jan: what if the cloud were public?
  * Public broadcast social media
* Tal: it's not just wanting to leave the city, **it's being excluded from it too!**
  * **alternative tools are a necessity, not a hobby**
    * it's not just LARPing/prepping
    * think of Beirut! Squats here

## Aussteigen Bitte

* Dropping out as an image
* the gotenna: mesh networks in slick
* vpns are mainstream
* 60s communes, glorification of 60s counter culture!

## Geological Metaphors and such

* **where does the ocean metaphor come from?**
  * in which ways does it actually fail in which ways does it hold up, can it be useful? or is it only occluding?
    * *see pirate radios*
  * can it be in the essay?
* water and electricity don't mix
  * **boating is not exactly a working class hobby**
* back to the land movement!
  * what does that mean digitally, what is 'the land'? it's not the cloud for sure!
  * it's also certainly not the ocean...
  * **If the internet used to be an ocean that can be surfed etc, what is it now?**
  * **the story of the woman who invented the term surfing the web is very interesting**
* the network is eternal and so is the ocean
* the term cloud literally meant the "unknown" part of a network diagram, the internet.
* **cybernetics comes from captain! sovereignty over spaces.**
* inter"net", fishnet
* I just want to say blog, blogbook, vlog etc again. vlogbook. I wonder if anyone on youtube has mader that joke.
* I like this idea of [the waste](https://howlscastle.fandom.com/wiki/The_Waste), the land outside that you cannot enter.
  * The evil internet of sorts, and your little digital platform, or boat, or moving castle, or luxury van, or spaceship (vehicle) is the thing that alloows you to survive in this otherwise hostile environment
  * from trust. might be a good followup to the cloud story?
* We need to go towards sailboats, other boats are bad for the environment!
  * Same for servers.
  * **Often servers are already wind powered (Netherlands)**

## Why is everything so Material?

* [Tubes](https://www.amazon.com/Tubes-Journey-Internet-Andrew-Blum/dp/0061994952), a journalist who's internet breaks because an animal chewed through a cable, then goes to visit all the actual hubs (Micaela)
* what happens beyond the blinking lights of our router? who knows
  * interestingly in a network diagram we draw this as a cloud
  * and that is how we see it: everyone understands they have a router and things connect to it, so the internal diagram everyone understands, but beyond that is just "the cloud"
  * the internet has become the cloud, but actually the internet was the cloud in the first place
* [gerogian woman cut the internet by acident](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access) (from Tina)
* **The cloud is NOT everywhere (even in germany it is not)**
* When talking about network politics, we also like to gloss over the fact how bad it is to build a computer, even an "ethical" one.
  * This weird divide between virtual and physical is also why I thought the Trust text was so whack, ok you use discord, but where does it run?
