* images: adas drawing when explaining squats always end, the squatting Sign, network diagram with cloud
* could be very cool to make more of the network drawings, what is ours right now, or what was it, who helped us? I anyway say how we needed the others, might be nice to name them
* the immediacy of a squat, it’s always urgent (and a lot of things are now)
* different ideas of freedom
* network of distributed servers is very nice
* i was thinking of tricks to make them nomadic but actually I think it can also be based on existing networks, eg friends. Maybe there could still be a backup if one node goes down
* i need to still go through my notes
* security/encryption
* would be sick to melt a computer
* but I also still love the idea of hiding… and antenna. How could a computer from used parts look? What could it do? Video streaming?
