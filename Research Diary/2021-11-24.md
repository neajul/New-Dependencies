Dear Research Diary,

Currently I am a bit frustrated being back in Amsterdam. The serenity of Sweden was exactly what I needed—no distractions. Here I have at least one phone call a day, and even 2 hours a day completely take me out of it, and I don't manage to do what I had planned for that day.

Spent most day at Sandberg doing other things, but finally started writing now. Yesterday at Hotel Mokum we had an emotional meeting—we met up and talked about how we feel in the chaos of it all. It was a very nice moment, and somehow I think it might be what I need in my thesis, I want to try describing it today.
