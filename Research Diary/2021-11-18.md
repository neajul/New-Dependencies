Dear Research Diary,

Today I am starting a bit later. We had some drinks in front of the fireplace last night (I guess that's part of the isolate-in-Sweden-experience), and my morning has been slower than usual. But I will start now. My plan for today: write about the NFT ship (and re-read that article, of course). I will see how long that takes me, and I am not sure if it will be useable information, but let's seeâ€”I guess it's good to start a practice of sketching, and being open to throw things away afterwards.

Let's see how my energy is afterwards, I would like to start reading/writing a bit about squatting, and see if the two thing are connected.

Also I want to call with Paul today about using this markdown/git structure somehow to publish directly to a website!

Oh also, today the sun was shining a bit, which is nice because it doesn't really get very bright here this time of year.
