Dear Research Diary,

we got evicted, fuck this shit. I'm too angry and tired to write it all down again. As a result I'm super delayed and missed the deadline for the first thesis draft. I was super on time, and then boom speed eviction. We went out with a bang though, but I was protesting all weekend so didn't really write. I now half assed-ly put everything together, but I guess it kind of works. I have some weeks to refine it so that's good.
