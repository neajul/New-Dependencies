Dear Research Diary,

It's the last day in Sweden, which is a shame. I have been able to concentrate so well here! Before coming here I was actually worried that I wouldn't be able to put the time into my thesis that I need to, since I really didn't manage to do this before. And, of course, the moment I am here, distraction free, without 5 other things going on at the same time, I am just naturally writing. It really does change a lot, *where* you write. 

(It reminds me of how with famous bands it's always a story when and where they recorded a certain album, but somehow with designers, artists or writers it seems to be less of a thing? Or maybe I just don't know, I guess with Picasso people analyzed when and where he painted)

Yesterday I started writing about the crypto ship, and I had a lot of fun doing it. The story is very strange, and the part about the metaphors for the internet kind of makes sense now (I guess I have been thinking about this for more than a year). I want to try to finish this part today and then I think I need a rough break, and I will start writing about squatting, get out of my comfort zone a bit. Let's see how it goes!
