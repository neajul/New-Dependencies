Dear Research Diary,

I love my new writing setup! Typora is so cool, I discovered it has these built in flowchart rendering features today. I think in a similar manner to where you write (Sweden), where you write (Your setup) is as important. I hope I can somehow put that in, because it definitely shapes what I do, for example I will now make some markdown tables to compare squatting and self hosting...

Also I had some good feedback from Leanne yesterday. She mentioned she would like to know more about how we organize at Mokum. I think that this is actually a really valuable idea, because I think there are principles in there that I can use to describe other parts of my practice, or that can apply to it. Maybe that's a good point to go towards in my essay? I also really think I need to explain the new dependencies thing, once i have talked about the squat.

To do today:

- compare squatting and self hosting
- make new structure/chapters
  - include reasons to refuse cloud
  - table to comparison between squatting and self hosting
  - new dependencies
  - history of squatting
  - how we organize?
- read more flusser and rene boer
