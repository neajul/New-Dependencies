Dear Research Diary,

I finished my text about Hotel Mokum yesterday and have re-read it a bunch of times since. It's a tight line between cheesy and good I think, and I'm a bit unsure on which side I stand right now. I will show it to Jan in a bit and see what he thinks about it, but I'm a bit nervous. I can't decide if it sounds like a coming of age movie or not.

Apart from that I'm actually starting to be really excited about my thesis. I think there are a lot of things still missing, but I hope the overall structure I have in mind works out well. Once that is the case I can see if I can fit more nuances in. I am specifically interested in the idea of nomadism as a form of preparation for disasterâ€”like a squatting group that survives eviction by moving to a new place, I still think that a server being able to do the same thing would be super exciting. Always ready for relocation. Always ready to serve.
