Dear Research Diary,

Not everything is as bad as it seemed on Monday. We met with the group, which helped a lot. Also I handed in the first version of my text, which is a big relief. I am not sure if everything makes sense yet, but I like it I think, and I find it exciting as well. So that's nice.

Today I went through the text of Silvio again, and got some really good points. Yesterday I also updated the structure document, to kind of be able to explain my argument, and the order in which the chapters appear. I made a list of everything that still needs to go into the text, or that would be nice. The list is quite long, but I do think the text will profit from it. I am quite excited actually to be where I am and still have a lot of time to improve it, with a lot of feedback.

For now I am intentionally not reading and changing my text. I think it will be better when I have some distance, also I want the feedback to be regarding the latest version of the text. I am super excited about Monday but I still have to read everyone's essay, so that's going to be quite a lot of work.
