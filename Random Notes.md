suqatting online:
domain squatting
piggybacking

the guy building a toaster from scratch

your computer doesn't belong to you

counter culture and computers have the same history

**back to the land movement!**

what does that mean digitally, what is 'the land'? it's not the cloud for sure!

it's also certainly not the ocean...

If the internet used to be an ocean that can be surfed etc, what is it now?

**the story of the woman who invented the term surfing the web is very interesting**

why did so many communes fail?

amsterdam city of squats

lets not forget pirate radios though, talking about ocean as a free space etc. it's not only bad.

collapse OS: an operating system that can run on almost anything when society collapses

IPFS: interplanetary file sharing lol

the network is eternal and so is the ocean

the term cloud literally meant the "unknown" part of a network diagram, the internet.

cybernetics comes from captain! sovereignty over spaces.

software is never finished, you always need to maintain it. like a boat, like a squat, like many things

steve jobs was once homeless (thinking about priviledge)

also richard stalman is so private, but also in a position to do that

also all the silicon valley millionaires that don't let their children use tech

who can just miss work for two weeks?

the ultimate dropout is ted kaczynski

Welcome to my Ted-Kaczynski-Talk

anprim, reject modernity embrace tradition

**tech is a race to the brain stem!**

feminist server summit, maintenance care

what is the difference between a server and a boat?

big tech is exploitative, and that is not an accident, that is by design (remember pursuasive technology lab, youtube algorithms, pull to refresh, like button etc)

- we are also talking about government/military technology here

**what would a nomadic server be? and why would this be a good thing?**

boating is not a working class hobby. tech and water don't mix.

VPN scams (internet historian could be a funny reference here)

the desire for privacy, but also being totally misinformed

anarchist yacht club



- D I Why?
  - why do people want to get off grid?
  - DIY Perks lol
- the guy who built a toaster from scratch (also something about a car maybe?)
- what exactly was the vpn thing of sascha etc?
- mesh networks
- autonomy vs interdependence. Hermitism vs. community.
- Open Seas. Off the grid living.
- wind powered, autonomous server/powered with a fan
- how to writing, how are tech tutorials written (with amy's class)
  - anja case stories
- 3D images like LOT of the server in nature
- thinking of anarchists yacht club, there are multiple kinds of boats. there is the big yacht, or the refurbished, squatted boat. Also, think again about where the ocean metaphor comes from, in which ways does it actually fail in which ways does it hold up, can it be useful? or is it only occluding?
- You can't reinstall Adobe before CS5, they disactivated the servers for activation
  - even if you bought the phsyical CDs

- I liek this idea of [the waste](https://howlscastle.fandom.com/wiki/The_Waste), the land outside that you cannot enter. The evil internet of sorts, and your little digital platform, or boat, or moving castle, or luxury van, or spaceship is the thing that alloows you to survive in this otherwise hostile environment
- [Feminist Server Manifesto kann man immer mal wieder lesen](https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml)
- I just want to say blog, blogbook, vlog etc again. vlogbook. I wonder if anyone on youtube has mader that joke
- I wonder how the wifi dish would hold up on a sail boat. Since it's made from wire it shouldn't catch too much wind I guess? could it be used to connect to something on the ocean?
- Tech and water don't mix...
- websites and opening times: why don't we turn our servers off at night? redirect them to one central page that logs different opening hours for different services?
- want to revisit the clouds video (didn't i write about this somewhere? or started to? also check what i worte for the exhibiton, i don't even remember)
- inter"net", fishnet
