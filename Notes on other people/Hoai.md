# My Mothers Home is not my Home



## Dear Reader

- does it make sense
- what do i feel?



## General

- it's so full of strong sentences!!!
- really thank you for sharing this
  - i do understand the question of how public this should be, i don't have a good answer
  - i already think sharing it with the group is very generous



## 1. Untitled

- damn what an opening, it's very confronting
- i like the use of footnotes
- Personality tests are interesting, reminds me somehow of emirhan
- The story about names is super beautiful for lack of a better word



## 2. Parallel lives/duties

-  there is no global citizen. Democracy is rare. My passports are not global.
  - damn
- This whole part is pretty hardcore, very honest, raw



## 3. chosen shrine

- the chosen family term is really interesting, i am curious about this adaptation of it
