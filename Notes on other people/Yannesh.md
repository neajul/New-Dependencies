# De Kinderen van Mokum

## General

- Name is a bit strange of course
- I think it could be interesting to talk more about Mokum... What is the history of this word, it's in a footnote, but for example there is no explanation of why the informal name of Amsterdam is a Yiddish word. Might be interesting.
- ==I want to hear more on city politics! On antikraak!==
  - why is antikraak shit? where does it come from? who came up with it? who maintains it? why is it not always shit? This is a law super specific to the netherlands that has shaped and is shaping the cultural scene immensely!
  - and similarly: squatting was criminilized, why was it legal in the first place? who decided that, when, how? it's illegal almost anywhere? what has that done for the city? same as above: this is a super specific law to the netherlands, and it has and is shaping the city
    - what are famous former squats in the city?
    - what are their stories? who are the people there? who were the people back then?
    - what are other alternative spaces here?
  - are the two "eras" in the city? The squatting era, until 2010 but probably also dying before, and the anti squatting era, we are on the height of it? What do those terms **mean** for the city/us/culture/free spaces
    - temporary contracts, precarity, temporariness, expats, speculation, vacancy etc etc
- I honestly don't care so much about the rave
  - I **do** care about the plan
    - the reasons to follow the plan
    - about scouting the location
    - about using it as a vehicle. 
      - I would love to have it mixed with some other infos, and where you do that it works really well.
- ==I also really like the ritalin sub plot, but it doesn't really re-appear==
  - that is one reason to talk about the rave maybe. There is some weird continuity of ritalin as child to raving as adult, but to be honest i think this could be two sentences.
    - which then leads to a story about 't Landje
- How does the plan end? With failure because this place is also antikraak now? Or maybe open ended, you leave the place full of resolution?
  - ==ending==

- And in general I sense a melancholy in the text, which makes a lot of sense, but I'm missing a bit the fight, the "kampfansage" as we say.
  - fighting




## Part 1

- Wondering a bit about the footnotes, are they necessary? What am I gaining from the naming of the tunnels?
- I want to hear more about antikraak and the betonnomaden



## The Rave

- I think it's a really good cliff hanger!
- I am not so sure about this part... I find the story about 't Landje much more interesting than that there is a rave, it's a bit this 90s nostalgia for raves, they happen, people get high ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è



## Dirk

- I'm wondering what you mean by LARPing as a middle aged white man. You just pretended to have a job, but you didn't pretend to be 50, you were next to the guy right? Haha
  - ==old man==
  - so also the "i will become one", you didn't really change anything about yourself, you just pretended you owned a petting zoo, which you totally could
- everything can be gone: the only possibility for a squat is to end
  - either legalized or evicted
  - there is no permanent squat
