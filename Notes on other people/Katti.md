## General

- The part in beginning about having your own opinion reiterated is interesting
- Gender/Race divide: I think right now you say more that they are different than explain it. There is a lot of "they are different, believe me"
- Why no chapters? might help
- The part about blackfishing, maybe explain what the Kardashians are doing exactly?
- I think it's really interesting to explore this topic against your first impulse to just dismiss it
  - however let's also not dismiss the fact that these people might be mentally ill
  - as a reader i would like to know more about this, how many people actually do this? it would seem to me that this is a really niche thing
  - also, there is always the chance people do this for attention/controversy
- If the idea is to take this seriously, i think it would be interesting to know more about the people that actually do these things
  - what are their reasons/arguments?
  - it feel like a really big issue
- How to deal with footnotes/references?
- A lot of people have written on online avatars, is that a part of it?

## Story

- I think the concept is super interesting, but not so sure about the actual writing... Show don't tell....
