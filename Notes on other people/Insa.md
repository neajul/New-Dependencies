## What she wants

- too fragmented/wandering off?



## What's in the text

- i somehow sense the German conundrum in here—fuck Germany but everything is better in German haha
- I think it's quite funny to accept that you are making a narrative, and to openly dismiss some references
- I have to be honest that after the megan the stallion part i get lost a bit. 
- I think it's a bit of a balance between the fragmentation/jumping around and making a point. It works really well while it stays fun for me, but towards the end of the essay it becomes really hard for me to follow what we are talking about.
  - also mixed with super long schachtelsätzen, can there be a moment of relief in between maybe, some kind of rhythm where this mode of writing comes and goes?
