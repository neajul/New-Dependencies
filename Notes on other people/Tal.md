# U Remind Me



## Dear Reader

- Is quoting Wikipedia awkward?
  - where did you do that?



## Ancient Egyptian song

- i was just wondering if tal wants to talk about her newly acquired Portuguese passport, in connection to the portuguese Tiktokers?
  - especially if you want to talk about DNA tests, obsession with the past? But maybe too personal also?



## If walls could sing

- not sure if you need to reference a youtube/spotify search
- might be an obvious reference, but the whole story about the Hieroglyphs, rosetta stone can be super interesting
  - especially because of the magical nature attributed to hieroglyphs before they were deciphered, there were entire clubs dedicated to them and their magic, until people learned to read them, which is when their interest slowly disappeared



## Memories and Histories

- i am not sure about the point about forecasting and fortune telling, i think it's simplified. I appreciate the critique of course, but there are differences, and we don't only "forecast" when we analyze the economy, but also in our own lives. We make predictions about our actions and those around us that are not based on fortune telling, take for example growing crops, predicting weather patterns and seasons (three body problem)
  - i guess you already mention something similar in your notes
  - maybe this history of forecasting (meta alert) could be interesting to add here? Why is this a necessity in the first place?
- also the text: against the scientific method, marxist text arguing from a scholarly perspective against the scientific method



## Do you Read me?

- I find the part about encryption super interesting (surprise), but i would like to hear more!
  - i guess she is aware of that
  - it's quite complicated of course, but I think especially the word public and private here are super interesting, and could maybe be more emphasized in how you mean them?
  - what is available to you privately, and what is publicly available?
- About stone tablet and ipad, sams thesis, the hand axe
  - not a coincidence, that's how they want it to be
  - https://kabk.github.io/go-theses-19-samuel-rynearson/
- I'm a bit skeptical about the mention of blockchain somehow, because that's not the only use of these, and if you don't go in detail maybe don't mention it
  - because like this we also don't gain so much from it, it's not really explained, but also not really used further



## Artifacts Everywhere

- for the can a meme become an artifact, maybe the question is more is an artifact a meme?
- but talking about memes, songs etc, also i think this idea of an artifact as a glitch is quite interesting
  - like compression errors are artifacts
  - which are also used a lot of times on purpose in memes (deep frying), from being copied again and again
  - somehow they legitimize memes also no
- I don't really see the need for the dictionary definition
