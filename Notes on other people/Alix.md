# The Space for Living



## General/Intro

- why is climate change a problem
  - i understand that you want to exclude opinions in which it isn't, but I feel like it has been answered to exhaustionâ€”you could make a list (shoutout to myself) to answer that question
  - i like what does the problem look like, because that implies the aesthetics of it, which is what you do when you write fiction
- About footnote/endnotes
  - I think not just for the sake of the thesis, but the readers would benefit from all the background info behind the text, or links to further readings, formulated concepts and ideas etc
  - But of course they shouldn't interfere with the text, even not in footnote format, that defeats the whole point of fiction somehow
  - Can there be a chapter in the end that gathers all the references per chapter? "The fact that they live in this unspecified slavic place is based on this." etc?
    - And probably one more additional literature part for things that are not in 1on1 correlation, but maybe still pointed out what specific aspects of a text you were drawn to
- The stories are amazing, I really **want** to read them
  - I read a lot of books like that
- I don't know about the present tense. I understand that it might say something like *this climate crisis is already here* but it makes it less smooth to read for me, I always stop at those sentences (especially since so little happens "now", and most things happen in the past)
  - balance between meaning and flow maybe?
- This is not cyberpunk of course but maybe ecopunk, but i'm wondering a bit: cyberpunk is an *aesthetic*, and it's fetishized. How can this not be that?
  - Like: when I read this, I get excited! I get vibes of the will smith movie where he is the last with his dog in the city
  - i know he doesn't describe this, but it's the expectation i get somehow from having read a lot of scifi, that these people will turn out to be heroes, but that's not what this is about
  - does it need to be more miserable? is that even possible?
