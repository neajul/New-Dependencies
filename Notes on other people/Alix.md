# Shedding Skins



## What Alix is asking for

- read gently, think along
- suspicion towards references
- What needs focus, what can go out?
- what is the red thread, or what could it be?



## General/Intro

- abstract: why do you mean language when you say text?
- maybe interesting the etymology of text: texture, something woven, joined, constructed, fabricated, built, to make
  - texture: same root
  - i think the constructed part is important, language is not "constructed", it's a construct, text is a construction?



## Words don't come easy

- the shedding skins thing makes sense, is very nice
- also the part about trailing off, but then i almost find the ending unrealistic, of just continuing reading, i can barely relate, because what i do is read the sentence another 5 times without understanding



## What is contained in the Space Between the Words

- I was wondering about the meme, because I think there are two ways of reading it. One she has explored quite in depth I think, but there is another one: A typeface being a trojan horse doesn't mean the ideology has to be in the typeface itself as with gill sans. But there is also the possibility that the ideology is in the text, and that the typeface, by necessity, since all text is set in typefaces unless they are hand written, dresses up this ideology. Letter shapes are beautiful, but what do they do in the end? carry ideology (text)

- The Cassandra part could be a foot note maybe? Like the story above
- I really like the parts about type setting rules. The Geviert for example. Somehow I could image that this is a really nice vehicle to transport things, to talk about extremely nerdy typesetting rules. Also talking about a typeface being a carrier of ideology. That way typesetting becomes a carrier for ideology.



## A Text Turning into Flesh and Blood

- writing a loop: die unendliche geschichte lol
- i like the hyphen thing also



## Being Complicit in the Creation of Meaning in Language

- Yes I agree, to an extent, but also I have my doubts on this. Sure you can set it in comic sans, but what about all those texts we have read that are bad photocopies. Yes of course it changes the experience, but this also always seems a bit like designers arguing why their job is important. Sometimes it doesn't matter whether it's Arial or Helvetica.
  - this also goes with the meme. Typefaces hold ideology, but because they are one container that text comes in, not only because it's somehow intrinsic to their shape.
