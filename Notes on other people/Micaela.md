- The interweaving of personal stories with more academic ones, does that work well?
  - my guess: yes lol
- what to cut, where too slow, where too fast?



## Abstract

- is political movement a political movement?



## General

- I think the lexicon in the end is great, i'm wondering if it can be more explicit somehow? the first footnote (see: directionality) threw me off until i understood it was referring to the lexicon, can the be marked somehow?
- Curious about the decision not to have chapters



## text

- Im wondering about the use of "freedom" on page 8. what does that mean exactly? freedom from labour, capitalism?
