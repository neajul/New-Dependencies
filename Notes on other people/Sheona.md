# Befriending the Spiral



## Dear Reader

- Is it really that fragmented?



## General

- A computer renders in a spiral, but is drawing intuitively really a spiral? Is it not more fragmented?
  - i feel spirals are quite linear
  - also have to think of pendula
- Ok so this might suck, but: in quite some of the chapters I wonder where the spiral is. But in almost all so far it has been about visual knowledge production, the difference between writing/reading and drawing/looking at images.
  - i think the spiral should be a sub part
- In general this text is kind of paradoxical, because it argues the whole time that there is something missing when we only write and not draw, but there are no drawings, hardly any images?
  - i think parts of this thesis need to be drawn, you clearly have an idea that i am sometimes not really getting it

## 1 spiral

- interestingly this is very similar to an ursula k le guin quote from alix's text (which might be the antithesis to yours)



## 2 structure

- There are two types of spirals i think. One is 2d, it has a center and goes outwards (or the other way around) and one is 3d, it always has the same diameter, but goes down or up. Is that a spiral? Like a spring kinda thing i mean.
- i really like the part about entropy, stable forms etc



## 3 linear non linear

- I was wondering about this before, why is a spiral not linear? it's just one line no?
- Vilem Flusser has great things about the differences between images and text in terms of how one presents linear thought (we write in lines) and one is multidimensional, non linear. Maybe the spiral combines the two, it's one line, but bent so it occupies more dimensions.
  - *ah she also mentioned a similar thing in next chapter, but could be combined*
- **iconoclasm**, why is it not allowed in a lot of religions to depict god or holi people, idolism, the iconoclasm wars
  - in respect to flusser also



## 4 reading (why is this different from point before?)

- I don't see why a comic book is a spiral



## 5 motion

- very curious where this will go, might be a good place to reference some artists? I am kind of waiting to hear you talk about images, like **specifc** ones



## 6 diagrams

- there is a whole movement about infographics, mostly journalism/advertising/marketing etc but still
  - there is an infographics course in augsburg (or there was 10 years ago), with exactly the reasoning that you can't explain some (complex!) things
  - it's not just esoteric or fleeting, it can be really concrete: corona graphs, election pie charts etc
