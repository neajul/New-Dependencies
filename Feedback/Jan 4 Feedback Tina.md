- she says self hosting notion gets left behind
  - **i think i have to make explicit that i am actively not talking about it**
    - also why i am doing this lol
    - is the term self hosting good enough? is it really what i mean?
    - good abstract material
- The who would win title is maybe stupid, it's a meme that's not used correctly, and it implies the two compete, while they should be together of course.
- the last part about de-appropriation should be made more explicit
  - this is also something will mentioned. I think i have to make clear that this analogy has a limit
  - somewhere a sentence like: "i think that the analogy of squatting can be helpful with the our digital conundrum, even though it obviously has its limits, exactly because the virtual does **not** follow the same spatial logic as the physical." Only when it comes to server space, of course, with infrastructure it does follow the same logic, but in terms of software it doesn't. have to think a bit more about this
- Add foonote for cloud video
- Tina thinks I have to tie the MS Satoshi part more in with the rest of the narrative
  - I have to re-write that part anyway
  - **I think I just need to dare to be more explaining, say what I actually mean.** For example a sentence here like: "there are different ideas of freedom, and the disaster of the MS Satoshi demonstrates the limitations of the individualist approach. As the scholar Flavia Dzodan put it, projects like seasteading always have to face the question of who is going to do all the cleaning in the end."
  - Maybe Francis Tseng could be a reference here? Urbit, another ocean. Is it a closed internet? A fenced of ocean like Truman Show?

- In back to the land part the part where i say the gap between the two collapse, the inequalities of one apply to the other needs expansion
  - **is that the moment i describe the internet being augmented? I think it would be good to say again there that it evaporated into the cloud, always there, especially in Amsterdam**
- in the occupying the land part when i talk about embedding yourself in the context, naming the squat after an address, it would be good to give examples.
- in the afterword, tina asks if i will add more to the AoA thing of unscripted strategies etc. i think i already did, but should examine this again
- tina also has some notes for the list of reasons to refuse list
