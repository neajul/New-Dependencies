First off let me say I think your work is wonderful, beautifully written with a lot of great insights.

As far as ASCII goes, and certain areas your work researches, I am a determined luddite when it comes to the cloud. I was recently reading Kenneth Goldsmith's book about his Ubuweb project "Duchamp is my Lawyer" . There he says "I love the idea of the cloud, but hate the reality of it. Trusting the cloud is a mistake: it's too centralised, too easily blocked, too easily controlled. And It's privatised, owned and administered by someone other than you."

Even though I try to disengage as much as I can from it, I loved to see your connections with squatting. I guess you know, I don't do social media at all... never even had a Facebook page back when it was popular.

I'm afraid that I don't have much time to go into depth at the moment... also since I try to stay off the keyboard as much as possible. But here are a few things:

- Indeed like you said, squatting was parallel, it ran on different values, created a separate culture, and had a different economic reality.

- My squat had a phone tree, like you mention. My squat was a pirate radio squat, which dabbled in pirate TV on the side. It was on the Herengracht.

- For me, although this might be personal, I also felt that the rise of the computer resulted in less social activism on the streets. It was almost like it was decided by some crucial players that the internet was the new radical possibility, and that was where freedom would be attained. What this meant in real terms, that many stopped demonstrating on the streets, and went inside to figure out this new technology. This was the 90s. 

- Also for me, both social activism and the cyberspace destroyed out anonymity around the same time. Late 90s/ early 2000s. You have already explained it in terms of cyberspace. In terms of social activism, the Schengen Agreement that was part of the all encompassing EU, dictated that you had to carry around ID with you at all times. This was true of places like Italy, which had never changed since the days of fascism, but it wasn't true here. The only time you had to carry around ID in Holland before was during the Nazi occupation. 

- That is about it. If you had more time (before you turn this in) we could have chatted and spent more time with it. But for now, I am off this thing!

Also, by the way, that first film event was co-programmed with Mateo, who picked the last film. 

You did a great job. I think you should print it out and distribute them. Also if you want I can send it to my working partner Cc, who is more knowledgable about the cyber aspect than me. But I won't sen it to her, unless I hear from you.

All the best. You all are doing such a magnificent job.
