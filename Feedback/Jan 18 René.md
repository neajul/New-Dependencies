Very happy Hotel Mokum is being documented in these kind of ways, and I really like to connection you try to make with developments in the digital realm (especially the post-2010 decline is fascinating, it also ties in with the acceleration of the smooth city in that decade).

Two thoughts:

\- not so important, but the figure of 1 billion "squatters" is a bit misleading; indeed about 20-40% of the world population are living in conditions that can be argued to have certain levels of informality (no deeds, no contracts, limbo or legally unclear situations, etc), but I think the term squatting comes with other associations that don't apply here

\- personally I would be keen to read more about what we can learn from squatting on how to operate in the digital world; you touch upon this towards the end but it could be interesting to expand here; how can non-normative spatial behaviour translate into non-normative digital behavior, and what would that look like? are there similar dynamics and pschologies (the game you can't win, etc)?
