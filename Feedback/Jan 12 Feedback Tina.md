# Points Tina

## Abstract

- The notion of self-hosting gets a bit left behind (or buried) as you work toward your conclusion. Just a thought.
  - **Is this fixed in the new abstract?**

## Comparison

- (empty comment)
  - **I assume it's about the title. I changed it, and have suspicion, but curious.**

- Last part, de-appropriation (interesting, could it be be problematized and/or worked into your text somehow?)
  - **I mentioned this in the last paragraph of back to the land, and in the last closing paragraph and abstract, enough?**

## 3 Back to the Sea

- The narrative around this is super intriguing and relevant, but could there be something to add that furthers or nuances Elmhirst’s the Ms Satoshi dilemma with regard to your own line of argumentation?
  - **What does she think of the new ending/re-written part 3?**

## 4 Back to the Land

- While this is clear enough something in this passage feels abbreviated for the ‘average reader’ … I can’t put my finger on it exactly but it there is so much info compressed here, feels like it needs more expansion.
  - **i added a footnote**
- The image
  - **that was the occupation of hotel mokum, is too edgy?**
  - **she mentions it's interesting i use the term negotiating, i'm curious what she thinks when she reads this?**

# Afterword

- She asks if i say more on the principle of reusing, how it relates to electronics
  - **i did a bit, no?**











# Convo

- what does she get from reading my text? anything?
  - she is not a geek lol
  - she wonders, if the scripting thing needs to be there?
  - ==maybe something gets lost in the diagrams? do the **need** to be coded?==
    - ==it looks clunky on the page==
    - ==it's not necessarily supposed to look clunky==
    - ==maybe it's positioning? design? Limitations of the page==
    - ==page numbers lol==
    - ==do i need the script always?==
    - 
- wordcount
  - ==ask will about shorten (ask with specific examples in mind)==
