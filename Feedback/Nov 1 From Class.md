book from micaela: tubes, a jhournalist who's internet connection got bitten through and then explores the physical internet: https://www.amazon.com/Tubes-Journey-Internet-Andrew-Blum/dp/0061994952

**note from people 1.11.21:**

- alix:

  - it's a bit like a logbook, with "in september 2008 this happened" etc, can this be emphasized on?

- tina:

  - funny that my refs are in the wayback machine
  - [gerogian woman cut the internet by acident](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/06/georgian-woman-cuts-web-access)

- jan:

  - can things be publicised? what about a public broadcasting social media?
  - can there be a public cloud?
    - the iphone chart, military tech etc, but all american tech

- tal:

  - when is open source a bad thing?
  - the most self organized countries are the ones that have sanctions
    - it's not only wanting to leave the city, but being isolated from the outside
  - what are reasons to look at self sufficiency?

- tina:

  - what jan said: lay some ground work, why is the cloud bad, why do i want to refuse it?
  - also: what is happening more recently, after 2008? What is going on now?

- katharina:

  - entanglements in general, and also personal stories of setting up the server
  - the wifi dish: the cloud is not everywhere
  - demystify the cloud, show that i did my research, it's physical, but other than that she likes it :)

- there are alternatives for everything: mastodon

  - but then katahrina says: not for everything there are alternatives (silvio's text)

  - **check that again**
