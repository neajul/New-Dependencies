## Notes from the conversation

- flavia likes it as it is
- technofeudalism
  - digital enclosures, the birth of app economy, cloud
  - private property, a continuation of private property
  - **techno feudalism and the tragedy of the commons, william kherbek**
  - enclosing information
  - Especially in regard to squatting. Kherbek, like in feudal times, the few own the property of the many.
  - coloniality
- community creation, is the central point
  - the collapsing part is "disappointing"
  - Think about how i can make more clear with it maybe? the collapse can be negatively connotated

- flavia wants more puns
- the ending is too short, can i go more into detail?
  - how does it intersect with private property?
  - is the network still a network or an enclosed playground?
  - it used to be an adorno public, but instead became private property like everything else
- **the squatting ban is 2010, which is the rise of app capitalism**
- **private property**

- the order made sense to flavia
  - from abstract to material
  - maybe cloud list in the end
- Jeffrey, talk to him
  - he was in squatting scene when David Bowie was there
  - then he moved to Amsterdam, saw the entire scene
  - need to be direct about my questions!
  - **ask him!**
- ontophany
  - the body cannot be separated from the technology it interacts with
