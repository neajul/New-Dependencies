# Session 1

**Leanne:** You have some very clear questions in the intro. Lets start with the overall structure...

**Katti:** So, what she noticed was how it is quite like how your reseaerch  developed. Hotel Mokum comes towards the end, how would it be to have  the relationship between these two much earlier and how that would  change how you read it. The placement of the physical space before. It  depends on how you want people to read it, if you know the background  maybe it changes the tone. She enjoys the aspect of refusing the cloud.  Its nice that you make it easy for the reader, nice in the middle of  things. She likes the cloud gazing, back to the sea, nice titles and she wishes you would continue this. It could be nice imagery of the  physical landscapes. 

**Yannesh:** It was interesting to read, the Hotel Mokum seems randomly placed. It  needs architectures of approporation and then Hotel Mokum. It feels as  if the context is missing, as hotel mokum is a personal topic especially how you have written it here. It could do with more interweaving – What you do at the end, who would win – making these aspects more  interweaved. This is yannesh' notes on how it flows. 

**Insa:** Would you like to include the anti-krack thing. The anti-crack (not meth!! do meth!! wet of geen wet! methen gaat door) can be used in open source movements and the observation on strategies  of survival incorporated in captial itslef, capital tries to make these  structures work for themselves. 

**Katti:** The cloud gazing could be a nice intro to approach the topic in general. It was the start of things. 

**Will:** The question of what happens to the squatters and squat energy and  where it goes. You tell the history very well, the loss of these  communities and networks. He likes this idea of re-using and making use  of what is there. What it would mean to take one of these models of the  phone tree and how the alarms go out. Could you use this structure for  the text? You have drawn a lot of parallels and overlaps in the material and digital spehere. The sense as a reader is that you want to take  another step to take a reflective moement. we want more of the  reflective paragraph at the end. 

**Lukas:** Has the problem that he is over the word limit with other things he  watns to unclude. Nomadism. Squats are always temporary, every squat  ends. But there are groups that keep going – the IP address link with  nomadism, hosting, self-hosting, not sure how to open pandoras box  without adding another 1,500 words to the essay. Wondering in the second and third part, the part about history of surfing the web, the cartoon, the cripto boat, are they necessary? Feels like he is saying the least  but they also contextualise the ideas of thinking the internet as a  space. 

**Jonathan:** （；￣ ︶ ￣）

**Katti:** How you explained this is also a chain or line of thought. You give a  lot of information, maybe it would be good to write why and how these  topcis are connected in a straight forward way. How you explained it  just now was already a good way of explaining

**Rudi:** When there were still squats around adn they had time to route in  communities, they really connected with the neighbourhood, if you relate it to nomadism it feels like giving up on this ideal of the squats  being a part of hte city. 

**Katti:** Has a questino to Rudi. When we think of occupying spaces, squatting is about occupying spaces in the city, this is a temporary thing,  criticising the occupation of the space forever. This is a questino, not formulated as a question but is how Katti understands it. Maybe we are  not meant to occupy spaces forever.

**Lukas:** Thinking about this idea of property. When you squat a space do you own it? do you have this space? What he means specifically is that the  moment that ot301 bought the space as a collective they no longer are a  squat. They are a legal squat. This moment of being an illegal squat has to end.... Ad Hoc squatting 

**Rudi:** These communities in the 70s that started communities outside the city – very much like the cloud, the silicon valley ideals

**Katti:** Nomad, you already name the chapters like a travelller. 

**Will:** It seems to me like an example of negative, what you end up saying is  something about how autonomy is not about separation. Give yourself more time to go where you want to go. (Sorry I diddnt get it all) 

**Leanne:** It feels at time judgemental. It would be nice to leave it open for the reader to judge. It could be nice if the way you describe the actual  situation you are clear with what kind of person they are and the reader can recifer their own judgement. 

**Insa:** Why is it judgemental? These techniques serve as a point to not act in  solidarity and push their agenda of the survival of the fittest. It  serves a point to say that this guy is a blueprint for the other model.  Sometimes has a problem that people say its judgmental to call  antivasxers an anti-vaxer because it benefits the anti-vaxer. 

**Leanne:** Maybe it is better to explain that by not getting vacinated you are  doing A or B. Its relevant to talk about this whole pandemic. Talking  about cutting words, make it more timeless by not mentioning pandemic  tings or going into it more. 

**Yannesh:** The list felt like an interesting read but also a lot of words, not  necessarily benefitting the essay in the reading flow. It became an  island in the larger essay. 

**Lukas:** It could be put at the beginning. Doesnt want to argue for it but wants to take it as a starting point. We all know this, but if he doesnt  include it then there is an assumption that everyone knows. FOOTNOTES  ;) 

**Katti:** The text feels longer than it is, you are giving a lot of infomration  and then as a read you have to do the connections for youself. What does this mean in the context of the topic. Maybe doing the work isnt so  bad, But in the last chapter you give your own statement and connect  them. Maybe it is nice to have them inbetweeen more so the reader has to work less. 

**Leanne:** It reads well, like discovering a lot of information. Some things you  know and some you dont. You explain is sharply and quickly, seems  written easily. 

**Yannesh:** Its a heavy list in teh middle of the text and then taken back to the  land. It pulls you to another place, its still super interesting and  good ot have in your back pocket. 

**Will:** It seems like something that could live on a bookmark that you can take home. 

**Rudi:** Connecting the cloud with something very specific to the netherlands. 

**Lukas:** references 2013 m3m3. Connecting squatting and internet activism. LAB.  Marleijn Sticker (?) She wrote a book – The internet is broken. 

**Leanne:** The Digital City – a lot are from the city. A squatting attitude re-enacted on the internet. 

## Notes Lukas took himself

- maybe it’s about nomadism? is that maybe the red thread?

  - squats are nomadic

  - back in the days there was all these cultural things going on at squats?

- property/deappropriation/making available, can we even own a place?

- nomadism: places to visit

- less seasteading, more what i actually want

- less judgemental?
  - anti vac/tax, what is freedom?
  - different ideas of freedom

- do i have to explain this?
  - not sure if i want to open that can of worms
  - but i think this idea of different ideas of freedom, could be more explained

- reasons to refuse the cloud: reasons to squat the cloud?

- more guidance: what does the information mean in the context of the essay, guide people more through it.

- Marleen Sticker, waag society

  - the digital city (de digitale stad)

  - the internet is broken

- these squatters also had conversations about who can do what, an old man  having a young girl avatar, how open is open, what are different ideas  of freedom?

# Session 2 Lukas

-recap 

**Tina:** burning question(?). Seasteading (as a footnote?)

**Lukas:** Wondering, lot of historical context to network activism in NL, has anyone has made this explicit?

**Tina:** attention, visibility and solidarity to these passing legacies, also you as an outsider here (not Dutch)

 on sourcing= do some of these sources want to point out to facts, link the footnotes. ---> could be more than a link, there are some juicy things in those links, so maybe in the body 

**Lukas:** when i was writing, footnotes were close to the text and not in the  end. i wanted them to be on the page they are referencing. 

**Tharim:** reading knowing that u had to cut out words... surfing the web, back to the sea, maybe these paragraphs should be one big paragraph ?

at the end of back 2 the land chapter--> the middle part could be shrunk

**Lukas:** bad at kill your darlings.</3.. but maybe theres a way to mix the chapters with something else instead of cutting them 

**Tharim:** could be nice if u give a brief view of what u think the cloud is

how do you want to do the chapter 4, unordered list of reasons? keep it as a list?

**Lukas:** yes. keep it as a list. Maybe not everyone understands this.. i feel  like everyone knows what the problem is, i dont want to spend time on  doing this explanations. 

in part 3 & 4 they connect very directly. & then part 5 also. This was a good moment to mention the problematic of it, but it could be an  appendix.

**Tina:** i like the idea of the appendix

**Lukas:** Takes away from the lightness of the beginning part. Had an idea of a  direct comparison in the end, squatting-selfhosting list, better as a  table, 

**Tina:** maybe this is a question for Will, if its an appendix you could cross-reference it

**Lukas:** yes maybe like see page 30. 

**Tharim:** The tables is very clear, maybe it could be the oppening

**Lukas:** yes and the cloud list is the ending.

Im talking about squationg but not really. I wanted to interweave it with the interenet stuff. Its a vehicle.

Already written about it, hence couldn't really break internet stuff.

**Tina:** the presentation was great. u did a lot of work between now and then. 

**Lukas:** thinking if i should inclode from where im writting, sweden / hotel mokum, but i droped out of it

**Insa:** thought it was super fitting with refusal and privilage that u have...  this in a way is another conter image. it fits to include you go to  sweden you have this opportunity. its a bit like glamping

**Lukas:** yes thats why i found it inticing to go there. watching on youtube  these ppl living off the grid for so many years.. but I didt know where  to place this.

Anothwe question I have is like the privilage to just drop out... I  intentionaly left it out. It felt like I am writing to cover my ass.  look I am aware of my privilege.

Is the idea of privilage to do thse thing s i am writing about is evident in the text.

**Ton:** have a distance from your text, not write about it personally, that is interesting

**Tina:** where do you see your personal being interjetced

**L:** Maybe in the arch-de-appro section, tactics of survival and politcal  actions of others, privelge game when one talks about refusal, awareness of ones privilege

Does it read as a blind spot in the essay, it is not present enough, needs to be present enough??

**Tina:** Appendix- how we talk about (formulating) precarity (about living in Amst,) finding the balance

**Tharim:** text about comparison (but not specific to amsterdam?)

**Insa:** getting to neoliberal understanding the things, the scale/spectrum,  filled with good cues and blind spots, house in sweden as the part to  explain that, 

**Lukas:** reflecting on who I am, as a person

# THIRD ROUND

**Lukas:** we talked about nomadism in the morning. If this idea of nomadism can  be translated to the network. Shortening, maybe shortening the sea  steading part. The idea of refusal and the privilege connected to it.  The hotel mokum disclaimer and the different levels of nescessity. A  tactic of survival. Alternative network structures. Glamping in Sweden,  maybe it could be an entrence into this discussion. 

**Jill:** Leave out the Swedish house and the privlige section. They are not  needed. You may not have a situation where you are squatting to survive, but you have the right to more space than Amsterdam atm allows. I would mention it in one or two sentences but don't focus on it. Something in  the making could be, the last bit ran a bit short. The dear reader  section is very concice. Maybe kill one of your darlings. Your word  plays work very well and make the text more lively. Did you think of the word ontophany. (??)(see Flavia's lecture) Jill loves your text and  will send you references.

– ontophany (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01164475)

**Will:** I started to think about this shitty streaming sites that always have to move. Malware, as a way to occupy something. 

**Lukas:** is there a way that a server can travel? I find this interesting on a practical level.

**Will:** to avoid the need to match them one to one

**Lukas:** I was also stuck with this question, but I think it is oke that it doesn't match one on one.

**Jill:** How to use the images?

**Lukas:** I didn't include any images, I was wondering if I need to show them. For now I decided no. 

**Jan:** to me the list of reasons to refuse the cloud, some struck me as  shifiting the target. This part could be stronger if the cloud was  understood in a narrower sense. 

**Lukas:** the aesthetics of squats - the list needs work
