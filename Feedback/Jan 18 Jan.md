## my questions

- diagrams?
  - could be footnotes, not necessary to show the code itself



## comments jan

- ending: what are the strategies we actually take from the squatting?
  - wifi
  - self hosting (with paul)
  - what else can we do
  - archive (decentralized, p2p)
  - *signal groups and matrix servers*
  - **what are these conclusions**
- should i talk about p2p at all?
- abstract
  - take for granted, maybe i assume/expect/require?
- 1 cloud gazing
  - mythical or mystical?
    - mist-ical?
    - roland barthes, myth
      - we all buy into it, but it doesn't exist
  - also frederic jameson essay on neuromancer
- 4 Back to the land
  - cyberspace as the magic space, maybe could be a footnote to neuromancer?
  - with anonymity the optimism had left. Causailt or correlation?
    - it infringed upon out lives as it became augmented or whatever
- Kraakspreekuren
  - **only one u**
- De Digitale Stad
  - **only one a**
- no class-less computers
  - McKernzie Wak cpaital is dead
  - labor in digital age gave rise to new class divisions (hackers and vectoralists)
    - hackers are precarious, info labor
    - vactoralists control vector information, IPs, patents
    - apple doesn't make anything, foxconn does, they just have patents
  - class is not about skill, but access to means of production
    - social mobility part is difficult
    - you can go from working to middle class
    - but is that what's happening here?
      - maybe it's about liberating computers from class context
      - liberating labor from class. Do i have to be a computer to compute? plumber to plumb?
      - labor changes when there are no wages tied to it anymore
        - when you earn money with programming you are a programmer, if you are a squatter who programs you are a squatter
        - if you are an artists......... a designer.......
- Maybe put back the sad teenagers in the list
  - McKenzie Wark text material reading of why it makes us sad



## Notes

- anonymity (only and physical)
