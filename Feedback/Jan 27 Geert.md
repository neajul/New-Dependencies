**spatiality**

- 90s: the idea of space
  - occupy the virtual, occupy the real
  - it's a metaphor, but it's also real

- late 90s the idea of space was dropped
- infrastructural turn
  - talk about the internet in spatial turns again
  - shift in attention to data centers, sustainability
- 2000s, locative media
  - local but... locative?
  - people investigated that, but kinda failed
  - startups
  - free local wifi

**squatted hacker spaces**

- still exists, continues
- the dominance of the platforms, the disappearance of smaller platforms in favor of centralized platforms has made it more difficult to talk about alternatives
  - young people think of internet as a handful of platforms
  - space, localities, local communities, it's hard

**hacker culture late 80s early 90s**

- he had his first machine in 87
  - BBS, interconnected machines
- hacktic? 88, 89
  - CCC from hamburg
  - there is a whole 80s history
  - hacker/squatter infrastrcutre
  - until mid 90s, then it kind of separated
  - they focused more on tacical media side
  - late 90s, ASCII
    - dyne.org
    - jaromil? they were based in amsterdam, he would say they are still based here
