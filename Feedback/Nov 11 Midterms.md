Writing: Autonomies / creating dependencies / analogy digital space versus physical space

The analogy comes together well with your wifi dish in hotel mokum

Maybe also nice to experiment with bringing the two together in two different forms? Writing about one, visualising the other or the other way  around? 

Notes and feedback 

- How you strung things together was great 

- left Tina wanting to know more about what these new dependencies are 

- Building relationships, even in an autonomous situation, with neighboors for example

- Who do you make things available to? Links to the open source discussion 

- leane : make it more physical, your body of work. could it be interesting  that the writing is only on one or the other? and the works also? when  you talk about hotel mokum and neighboors I wanna know more about it.  Great stories NTF'$$$$ 🤑

- Jan: This is what your bringing up is not just a serconstancial quastion its a fundumental question. MArx quote: <<https://newsocialist.org.uk/be-comrades-web-life-conversation-jason-w-moore/>>

- Audre Lorde > Master’s tools will never dismantle the masters house

- Liking this shift – perhpas a result in being grounded and working on this  squat in a more hands on way, site specific, grounding in a physical  place. It shows GROWTH 

- Amy: new dependencies through your writing? could be explored further

- Mokum exhibition was wonderful and that it is coming into theory is great, excited to see and read about it 

**Quote Jan (link above)**

In ‘Critique of the Gotha Programme’, Marx talks about how any  hypothetical communist society would enter the world bearing the  birthmarks of the old order, and quite a lot of Marxists seem to read  that and say, “that’s fine, we don’t need to do anything about it now  that we’ve recognised it’s the case; we still have to use the  instruments of the old order, and somehow a critical awareness will be  enough.” It’s the big question of revolutionary Marxism, isn’t it? To  what extent are the old tools useful, if at all?
