# Reasons to Refuse *the Cloud* (in no particular order)

- Workers in the global south are being exploited and our devices are assembled by modern slaves.
- Rare earths such as Lithium are extracted from indigenous lands without their consent and unaccounted for consequences for the environment.
- E-Waste is polluting the planet and is being dumped in landfills without regulations in the global south, poisoning both the lands and the people.
- Tech companies and governments by extension are constantly spying on us. The right to privacy is being eroded and the surveillance state is being facilitated.
- For almost a decade we have had reliable evidence that tech companies are padding on information to US government agencies such as the NSA, yet nothing has changed.
- Social media companies profit from a divided political landscape, disconnected filter bubbles are not a by-product but part of the product.
- The massive proliferation of fake news actively costs lives (see: anti vaccers) and is being facilitated by the big platforms.
- People are led to believe in conspiracy theories and are being radicalized to the point of committing physical violence and domestic terrorism.
- The internet, and most devices we carry in our pockets like smart phones developed from US military technology (possibilities for surveillance for example are no accident).
- *Tech* is a race to the brain stem. Some of the best-educated people in the world spend all their energy in selling us ads. Thinking we could resist the machinery is like thinking we could win against a super computer in chess.
- It's addictive on purpose. At places like the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab people have been trained to specifically find ways of persuading users to keep using their products, and metrics like engagement are still the main factors their design.
- Big companies that have terms and conditions instead of constitutions can censor users without any form of accountability or oversight.
- Even though participation is always voluntary, social pressure, especially on children and teenagers, to participate outweighs any serious form of alternative.
- Depression among young people is on an all time high, and suicide rates are steadily increasing.
- In more authoritarian countries it's used as a tool to brutally suppress any form of opposition
