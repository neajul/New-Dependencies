# Reasons to Refuse *Big Tech*, in no particular order

(the cloud being more of a stand in here for everything *big tech*)

- Workers in the global south are being exploited and our devices are assembled by modern slaves.
- Rare earths such as Lithium are extracted from indigenous lands without their consent and unaccounted for consequences for the environment.
- E-Waste is polluting the planet and is being dumped in landfills without regulations in the global south, poisoning both the lands and the people.
- Tech companies and governments by extension are constantly spying on us. The right to privacy is being eroded and the surveillance state is being facilitated.
- Social media companies profit from a divided political landscape, disconnected filter bubbles are not a by-product but part of the product.
- The massive proliferation of fake news is doing active harm to our lives and is being facilitated by the big platforms.
- People are led to believe in conspiracy theories and are being radicalized to the point of committing physical violence.
- The internet, and most devices we carry in our pockets like smart phones are based on American Military technology.
- It's a race to the brain stem. Some of the best-educated people in the world spend all their energy in selling us ads. Thinking we could resist that is like thinking we could win against a super computer in chess.
- It's addictive on purpose. At places like the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab people have been trained to specifically find ways you persuade users to use their products.
- Big companies that have terms and conditions instead of constitutions can censor users without any form of accountability or oversight.
- Even though participation is always voluntary, social pressure, especially on children and teenagers, to participate outweighs any serious form of alternative.
- Depression among young people is on an all time high, and suicide rates are steadily increasing.
