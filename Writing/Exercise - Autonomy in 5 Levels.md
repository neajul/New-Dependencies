level 1: **autonomy** means that you can make your own decisions, without someone else deciding for you what you have to do.

level 2: **autonomy** describes the ability to act on your own accord, independently from others that control your behavior. An example for this are autonomous cars, which can drive without the need for a driver to steer them.

level 3: **autonomy** describes the ability to make decisions that are not dependent on others. Autonomy is an ideal that can be strived towards but never achieved fully, since the idea of complete autonomy is an illusion.

level 4: **autonomy** is the concept of freedom from the influence of other actors over one's decisions and actions. It applies to many areas of life, whether it's political autonomy, social autonomy, financial autonomy, etc., but it is also used as a concept to describe things like technology. Autonomy is somewhat of a paradoxial word, because one the one hand it certainly exists and is a useful term to describe states of emancipation from existing structures, on the other hand it's elusive and non-existant at the same time. True autonomy can never exist, because of the dependencies that are necessary to achieve it. Autonomy is always born out of dependence, or a reaction to it.

level 5: **autonomy** is the proposed antonym of dependence. It can relate to many different aspects of life, and is more of a platonic ideal than a real occurence. In daily life it's a useful term for describing certain power relations, but on closer inspection it usually only applies to fragments of a given situation. Autonomy is a dream that seems to be inherent to human society, the idea to live completely independently from factors outside of the self, but of course this is completely at odds with place as a species in nature, but also the social nature of humanity as a whole.
