# Missing Dependencies

I think my thesis is about autonomous spaces, even though I am doubtful that is the most precise way of articulating what I mean. I am interested in physical spaces as well as digital spaces (and where they overlap!)—Any kind of spaces that someone, or a group of people have carved out for themselves in order to take some form of control. I actually think there are quite some similarities between these two types of spaces, and their respective alternative struggles towards independence, and in some places they inform each other, even though they are, of course, not the same.

In physical space, a good example for this might be a squat: Squats are often reactions the fact that living and working spaces in cities are not as available as they are needed. In Amsterdam, in 2021, most rent contracts are temporary—or even worse: antikraak agreements—and the rents have become so high as to slowly push everyone that earns less than a certain amount of money first to the city's periphery and then out of it completely. Squats try to (literally) reclaim space, and make it available to those who need them. The reasons for this can be manifold: it could be a political action, someone's last resort and only alternative to homelessness, or anything in between.

Digitally, a good example for an autonomous space might be a server that someone runs at home, and which could host files, websites, or messaging applications for them and their community. It might be connected to the internet or not, might be publicly available or just for them and a small group of friends. More and more, our lives happen in the cloud, with all the implications that brings. Self hosting, even partially, might be an attempt at understanding this opaque piece of infrastructure from within as well as an attempt to escape it altogether. But it might also be a necessity, an attempt to escape the mechanisms of control that are inherent to information technology, and the suppression exercised by local regimes on their citizens.

Both of these attempts take an area of life that we navigate, and refuse to play by the imposed rules. They chose to create an alternative space instead where at least some of the rules that define it can be rewritten or at least co-authored. In that way they cut with the dependencies that usually come with them: dependencies on income, landlords, tech companies, governments. But while they might be part of a struggle for autonomy they can never be truly autonomous: squats and homebrewservers present precarious situations, eviction and data loss are often imminent, and even if not, remain a constant possibility. This precarity comes with its own dependencies, whether it's neighbors, police, online forums or open source applications. Further more, both depends on existing infrastructure: buildings need have to have been built, circuit boards printed, open source tools developed. Autonomy, in this case, is a relational description at best (the situation is *more* autonomous than previously), and a euphemism at worst. It might be more fitting to speak of new dependencies: the ability to make choices about the dependencies one enters, instead of the illusion of ridding oneself of dependencies altogether. New dependencies also inherently presupposes communal effort, since none of these efforts are of individual nature.







*So what is it about these spaces that I want to say? What are autonomous spaces, should I make lists? Should I describe what are **not** autonomous spaces? Should I critique autonomous spaces? should i talk about why they are necessary? about my experience there, especially as a novice, or as a queereinsteiger?*

*What are dependencies in programming?*

*what is autonomy by definition?*

*where do these spaces overlap? for example in email accounts, clouds of squats. Servers in squats. Domain squatting?*

*squatting is just a tactic*
