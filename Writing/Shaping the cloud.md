On September 12th, 2010 the Youtube Channel revelation13net uploaded a video titled *By Psychokinesis a Psychic turns a Cloud into a Square Cloud in Sept. 2010.* In this 02:18 video, a man is filming the sky with a handheld camera. Visible is a single cloud on an otherwise entirely blue sky, lined by some trees on the edge of the frame. We never see the person holding the camera but can hear them speak throughout the video. They introduce themselves as T. Chase and explain that they will now attempt to change the shape of the cloud into a square through psychic powers. They keep repeating this statement like a mantra of sorts, altering and distorting their voice as the video progresses. The cloud slowly changes shape, and by the end of the video it does look more like a square than in the beginning of the video, even though it's hard to say whether this might have just been the way it naturally changed shape.

In September 2008, the free software advocate Richard Stallman expressed his concerns regarding cloud computing to the Guardian, claiming that it was *stupid*[^1] and just a way to lock users into proprietary ecosystems. Stallman is a prominent advocate for privacy and the open source movement, and (among a lot of other things) founder of the Free Software Foundation. He is well-respected in the tech community, but his statements about cloud computing received mixed responses. He was accused of populism[^2], supposedly ignoring the lived realities of actual users who are often already trapped on their operating systems and office suites anyway and don't necessarily have the capacities to practice the cloud refusal he was preaching. Others accused Stallman of simply stating the obvious. Reuven Cohan[^3] illustrated this criticism with a still from an episode of the animated TV show *the Simpsons,* which ended up becoming something of a meme later. The image shows a newspaper clipping in which Abe Simpson, the elderly father of one of the protagonists, Homer Simpson, angrily shakes his fist at the sky under the headline *Old Man Yells at Cloud*. Since my 30th birthday last month I sometimes think this image is actually about me.

The Cloud is a mystical space, its name is already opaque, veiling what it actually describes, which you could call network infrastructure, or maybe just: someone else's computer[^5]. Interestingly the term originates from exactly this position of not knowing, of occlusion. In network diagrams the cloud is traditionally used to denote parts of the network that we have no control over or no concrete knowledge about. It's the part beyond the blinking lights of our router, to which we understand our devices connect, the abstraction of *the internet*. Its shape alludes to the uncertainty of what is out there, something that constantly changes shapes, is hard to grasp.

This inherent uncertainty is maybe why attempts to refuse *the cloud* can often feel like yelling into the void. Even defining what it exactly is that we are refusing is a tiring exercise. As it often is with computers, the conversation is one-sided, with us yelling at the cloud, trying to shape it, but not getting a response, because the cloud doesn't generally care. Still, a vague feeling of urgency remains.

In 2019, web designer Becca Abbe sensed the dawn of what she called the internet's back-to-the-land movement[^2] on the are.na blog, in reference to the 1960s counter cultural movements in the US (which, in turn, directly informed the early beginnings of Silicon Valley's tech world). It seems tempting to leave the celestial cloud, with all its fake news and privacy issues, behind, to get back down to the *ground truth* so to say. But what exactly is this *land*, which we would return to, and who exactly is it that gets to go back there?

Before the cloud was a cloud it was an ocean. In 1986, when the internet wasn't commercially available yet, it was mostly being used by scientists and governments. That year, in the Netherlands, Hans Rosenberg from Utrecht University founded the non-profit *SURF* (Samenwerkende Universitaire Reken Faciliteiten, *Co-operative University Computing Facilities*), which ran *SURFnet*, a computer network linking different academic institutions. *SURFnet* still exists today, and, among other things, founded and operates *eduroam*, an authentication infrastructure letting users in higher education facilities use wifi, which many readers might be familiar with.

A few years later, in 1989, and in direct proximity to the ocean, Susan Estrada of the San Diego Supercomputer Center founded one of the first internet service providers (ISP) in the world. San Diego being a surfer's paradise, she originally wanted to call it SURFnet, but since that name was already taken, she settled for CERFnet, an abbreviation for *California Education and Research Federation Network*, and a reference to Vint Cerf, one of the inventors of the TCP/IP protocol and so-called fathers of the internet.

In 1991 her company released a promotional comic book, *The Adventures of Captain Internet And CERF Boy*[^6]. Filled to the brim with bad jokes and puns, it recounts the story of Diana Domain, her alter ego Captain Internet and her side kick CERFboy, fighting against their nemesis Count Crackula.

Unaware of this, just a year later, librarian Jean Armour Polly published an article called *Surfing the Internet* on the University of Minnesota Wilson Library Bulletin and shortly after that, Tom Mandel of Stanford Research Institute (SRI) wrote another one called *Surfing the Wild Internet*.

Polly (and probably Mandel) wanted to evoke the fun, but also the skill required to, well, surf the web, and the randomness, chaos, and even danger that the web itself presented [^7]. Computers and the internet are complicated and especially back then, when interfaces were less smooth, and personal computers were just beginning to become a thing, it perfectly captured this new, mysterious and seemingly bottomless place that was the internet (other exhausted geographic metaphors include cyberspace and the information highway).

Today nobody *surfs* anymore (the ocean has evaporated into the cloud, you could say). But, despite the immiscibility of water and technology, the image of the internet as a vast ocean, free from the constraints of the aground, physical world, that just has to navigated by a skilled steersman[^8] with an appropriate vessel[^9], lingers as residue if you know where to look; In the ports and berths that we use to connect our computers to the internet, torrent sites[^10], app icons of browsers[^11] or the names of NFT marketplaces.[^12] The Network is eternal[^13], and so is the ocean.

While some are on their way back to the land, others want to get back to the sea.

Next: the ship that got stuck escaping the land

in 2021 a ship got stuck that made a lot of memes, but another one actually got even stucker, the crypto ship

web3.0 sees the land as the waste that has to be avoided, so let's finally get to the question of what the land is.

the land is the infrastructure of the internet. It's cables (some of them under water, but at least aground), it's rooms, etc. Many have talked about this (tubes, evan roth, the transmediale woman)

maybe the division is a false dichotomy: we need to treat the digital with the same logic as space. Think about actual connections etc?

This is in
