I guess disorder means that something does not follow a system of organization. The underlying principle of disorder is entropy: the metaphorical desire of everything in the universe to reach a state of disorder. Seemingly itâ€™s one of the fundamental principles of life, the constant fight against states of disorder. This takes place on a level of (material) possessions, for example in the constant need to renovate your house every couple x amount of years, or, on a smaller scale, the constant need to clean your room.

But it also applies to psychological well-being. Self care is about maintenance in the end, about routines, however small they are. A state of mental disorder implies stress, disorientation, and paradoxically limits our capabilities to react to events that unfold around us spontaneously in an appropriate manner. A state of mental disorder means chaos for the self.
