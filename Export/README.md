# New-Dependencies
Dear Reader,

This is my Master Thesis *New Dependencies*. In it I ask whether we can learn from the political squatting movement when trying to build a more sustainable digital practice.

You can download the latest version here in different formats, at the moment:

- apple pages if that's your jam
- pdf for everything else
- While the text is initially written in markdown, I still need to do a bit of formatting before releasing the original file here.

Lmk what u think
